## Namaste 🙏

During the day I’m a senior iOS developer. I've been building iOS apps since iOS 6 and Objective-C days. It's mostly Swift at the moment.
<br/>
I'm also passionate about design, and I believe I'm a decent enough designer. In my projects, I combine my love for coding with an eye for captivating design.

Currently, building an iOS app to neatly organize useful links in a simplest way, alongside learning CloudKit & RxSwift.
