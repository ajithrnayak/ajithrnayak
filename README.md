## Namaste

A senior software engineer and wannabe designer based in Bengaluru, India. With nearly a decade of experience in iOS development, I'm currently building immersive mobile experiences as a Senior iOS Engineer.

As a curious tinkerer, I spend my evenings exploring web frameworks and experimenting with new technologies. My love for coding goes hand in hand with my eye for captivating design.
